# Code review

1. index.php:1-74 - Clean and easy to understand index-file.
2. index.php:4 - Not necessary to require this file here.
3. index.php:20 - You forgot to enter document title.
4. index.php:29-31 - I would suggest that you add alt-text on your images, for the accessibility.
5. index.php:36 - $room["room"] can be a confusing variable.
6. admin.php:1-98 - Great admin page with all vital functions.
7. admin.php:61 - Good to have the occupancy rate calculated.
8. calendar.js:1-85 - Do all updates from this script really work with the PHP code?
9. overall code: Somewhat difficult to follow with so many different files.
10. css: All .css-files could be placed in a common map.
